#Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills in Power BI, data analysis, and visualization. It includes various projects that highlight how I've used Power BI to transform raw data into actionable insights.


#Introduction

This portfolio contains a variety of Power BI reports and dashboards I've developed to solve real-world business problems. Iâ€™ve built these projects using different datasets, ranging from sales and marketing data to financial and operational metrics, applying a range of data modeling, DAX functions, and visualization techniques.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my ability to:

Transform raw data into insightful visual reports.
Implement advanced DAX calculations for deeper analysis.
Present data in an interactive, user-friendly format.
Collaborate and share interactive reports via Power BI Service.
